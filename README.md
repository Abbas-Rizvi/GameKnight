# GameKnight
## Description
GameKnight is a Game Library web application which can store and manage your game library across different platforms. The application lets gamers filter their game libraries to find and remember games from their past and find the games they want to play in the future. 


The application is powered using Django and connects to a backend database which can be configured in the settings. MariaDB/MySQL was used in application testing, however other databases should work if connected to Django in settings.

This project was created for the Data Management System Course

## How to Install
### Dependencies
Ensure dependencies are installed with current version or newer
```
Python 3.9.5
pip 21.3.1
```

Python packages should be managed in virtual environment.

In this project `pipenv` was used, though python virtual environments can be used.

If following this guide ensure latest version of `pipenv` is installed using the command:
```
pip install pipenv
```

## Installation process

Clone github directory and open src folder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/JadEletry/GameKnight.git
$ cd src/
```

Install required packages via `pipenv`
```
pipenv install
```

### Loeading into the virtual environment

In order to use this application you must run the virtual environment and execute the runserver command

```
$ pipenv shell
```

### Creating environment file
Before running the application, the `src/env` needs to be filled to allow the appropriate connections.

#### Database Connections
Find the database connection information for whichever database connection you are using.

This application was developed for a MariaDB backend, however MySQL should also be compatible. Other databases have not been tested, however so long as they are connected through Django, they should also work.

#### Secret Key
A secret key can be generated by Django through running the following command in the python virtual environment:

```
python manage.py shell -c 'from django.core.management import utils; print(utils.get_random_secret_key())'
```

Save this generated key in the SECRET_KEY field.

#### RAWG KEY
This project uses the [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs). 

In order to use this application you must get an API Key from their website


### Running Server

Inside the virtual environment run:
```
$ python manage.py runserver
```
The application should now be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/library/home`

## Features

### API

GameKnight also provides an API which can be used to retrieve information regarding your library in a standard REST format via Django Rest Framework

This can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/game`  

information regarding a specific game can be found at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/game/GAME_ID`, where `GAME_ID` is the id for the requested game
